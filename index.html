    <div class="para1"><p>Atlas is the MIS' first western band. We are now recruiting players, and 
        if you play a western instrument, you should apply! We will not only be playing in 
        assemblies, in school, but might participate in events in the future. Atlas was started  
        by Harsh Goyal and Ronav Singhal, and anyone from class 9 is welcome to apply. Before 
        applying, please read our application criteria, and join our discord server. 
        Atlas currently has spots open for acoustic guitar, electric guitar, cajon box, 
        keyboard and western vocals. See you up on the stage, with Atlas.</p>
